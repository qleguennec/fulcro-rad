    "Converts a Pathom 2 resolver or mutation into one that will work with Pathom 3.

    Pathom 2 uses plain maps for these, and the following keys are recognized and supported:

    ::pc/sym -> ::pco/op-name
    ::pc/input -> ::pco/input as EQL
    ::pc/output -> ::pco/output
    ::pc/batch? -> ::pco/batch?
    ::pc/transform -> applied before conversion
    ::pc/mutate

    Returns the input unchanged of the given item is not a p2 artifact.

    NOTE: Any `transform` is applied at conversion time. Also, if your Pathom 2 resolver returns a value
    using Pathom 2 `final`, then that will not be converted into Pathom 3 by this function.

    You should manually convert that resolver by hand and use the new final support in Pathom 3.
